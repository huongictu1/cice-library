Hello. Today I will be representing the Tiên Sơn Application team to present the report for 2023. Our presentation will consist of the following sections: introduction, review of projects in 2023, challenges during the development process, and finally, the plan for 2024. Now let's begin.

In 2023, our team remained stable with 3 members, responsible for the tasks you see on the screen. Our development roadmap continued to focus on PostgreSQL, Angular, and NetCore. In 2023, we successfully migrated the Capital Budget system. This migration will continue this year with the Uniform system.

Next, we will present the projects in 2023. The first project is Capital Budget, which is an old system developed in 2022 by a former member. This outdated technology caused difficulties in maintenance and development, so we decided to migrate it to NetCore and Angular while enhancing its functionality. The system was completed in May 2023. The main benefit of this system is a reduction in working hours, approximately 2077 hours per year.

The second project is In-house asset control, a system for managing in-house assets with the goal of recording daily working time, visualizing asset costs, and structuring assets. This project was completed in May 2023, with enhanced functionality in November of the same year. The system is currently fully implemented, and its benefits include avoiding data loss, automatic data linking, file calculation and export, reduced working time, and paper usage.

The third project is related to the sales department, a system for managing loaned assets. The system's goal is to maximize indirect work efficiency and minimize paperwork. The idea behind this system is to gather data from fixed asset systems, the Die management system, and user-uploaded data to create a process for creating new assets. This system started in July 2023 and is currently in progress. The benefits of this system, based on the PUC department's request, include reducing manpower by 9 people per year, approximately 600 working hours, and $1,000.

The next system I want to talk about is the Fixed Asset Management system. This is an old system developed in 2021 with basic functions such as transfer, disposal, and confirmation. In 2023, we continued to enhance other functions as shown below. Currently, some new functions have been implemented, and the management of CIP is being processed. The estimated benefit of this system is approximately 16 working days per month.

The last project I want to introduce is the PSI system, which stands for production shipping inventory. The goal of this system is to automatically plan production and minimize inventory management. The idea behind this system is to collect data from multiple sources, perform calculations, and provide outputs to users. The specific data inputs include NPIS/EUC, master data, the Receiving system, and other systems. The outputs include master structure, forecast delivery volume, turnover day, and lead time. This project started in June and had 2 functions implemented by September. Two more functions have been developed since then, and testing is ongoing. These are the four major functions, and this year we will continue to develop the remaining functions and expand to other factories by 2025. The benefits of this system include workload reduction, improved quality, and cost reduction. We have received positive feedback from the departments.

Next, I will talk about the challenges in 2023. These include a lack of knowledge, which occasionally leads to troubles. We also faced a shortage of manpower due to occasional sick leaves. However, we always strive to improve our knowledge and manage tasks to ensure projects stay on schedule. Despite these challenges, we achieved some accomplishments in 2023, including IT department awards, awards for other departments, and a promotion for one team member.

That concludes my report. Thank you for listening. Does anyone have any questions?

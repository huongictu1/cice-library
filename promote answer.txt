Q: How to resolve conflict in team ?

A: When I encounter conflict in my team, I always prioritize listening and understanding the perspectives of all parties involved. First, I will try to understand the cause of the conflict and listen to all members to ensure they have the opportunity to express their opinions. Then, I will look for common ground and encourage everyone to focus on the common goal of the team.

During this process, I try to keep the working atmosphere professional, ensuring that all members feel that their opinions are respected. If necessary, I am willing to act as a mediator to help resolve misunderstandings or disagreements. My ultimate goal is to ensure that the conflict is resolved constructively and does not affect the team's performance.






Q: The most difficult point when develop PSI project ?

The biggest challenge in developing a PSI software project is often managing the constantly changing factors in production and demand forecasting. PSI systems require timely and accurate data updates in order to make informed decisions. Another challenge is integrating existing systems with the new PSI software, ensuring that all data from different departments is properly synchronized. This requires careful testing and constant coordination.

Communicating with relevant departments can be difficult, especially when each department has a different view of the process and goals. For example, the manufacturing department may prioritize fast delivery times, while the finance department wants to optimize inventory costs. To address these challenges, I always try to maintain clear and transparent communication. I hold regular meetings where departments can exchange views and find solutions that work for all parties. The goal is to ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities in the project, while creating a common understanding and collaboration.

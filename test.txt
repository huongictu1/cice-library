A: That's PSI project (Production Shipment Inventory).	
As you know, PDC1 mainly job is make production plan and inventory management.
Before, they using excel file, macro and manual jobs. So, it's slow and difficult to improve quality.
from last year, I co-operate with PDC1 to develop PSI system.
Until now, we collect some actual result.
The first, reduce workload 14 persons.
The second, remove manual jobs 50%.
the third, accuracy archieved of inventory less than 0.1%.
finally, increase operation flexibility about 5%.
In this year, we have plan to expand to TL, QV.

A:My strong point: In my dailly job always have monitoring activities (by monitoring system, by logging, by email).
It help me optimize our products and prevent risks/trouble happen.
My weak point: because I cannot understand department job, so I take time to study to develop system.
To overcome weak point, I have 3 action:
the first dept hold meeting to explain their detail requirements. They will show background jobs: which manual job, excel fille and macro.
the second, increase communicate, actively genba workshop to deeply understand job finally, I will provide fix  forms for department to fill out, through  which we will better  understand

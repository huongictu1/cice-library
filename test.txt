Q: Introduce yourself, your mission .
A: Firstly, I'd like to say thank for giving me a chance to be here today.		
My name's Huong, I'm a member of Application group, IT department.	
I have been working at CVN since Febuary.2020.	
Now, with aiming development, control and operation of IT system and program.
I'm person in-charge to do 4 main jobs.
The first, I'm leading TS application group, training, skill up and follow up.	
The second, I take care database of Hoan Kiem system.
The third, I develop production admin system PSI.
The fourth, I develop & maintain indirect system such as: Birthday Card, Fresh summer, Contract, CICE. 
That's all about my introduction. Thanks for your listening.

Q: what is the biggest archievement
A: That's PSI project (Production Shipment Inventory).	
As you know, PDC1 mainly job is make production plan and part-inventory management.
Before, they using excel file, macro and manual jobs. It has 3 big problem:
+ It make quality not high accuracy depend on human skill.
+ It is many manual job so take long time to finish.
+ It very hard to adapt production flexibility.
from last year, I co-operate with PDC1 to develop PSI system.
Until now, we collect some actual result.
The first, shoujin 5.2 persons.
The second, remove manual jobs 50%.
the third, support improvement inventory accuracy target less than 0.1%.
finally, increase operation flexibility about 5%.
In this year, we have plan to expand to TL, QV.
		
Q: How to manage team (how do you control the job in your team) ?		
A: To follow up a project.
The first, after clarify the requirements, we make a project plan
The second, at the daily morning meeting, we update the process and show difficult points to get advice from other members.
The third, we also hold regular meeting in my team once time a week.	
confirm actual result job and explain archieve or not archieve.	
After that, together to solving not archieve immediately.

Q: After you will be upper grade, what can you to do/contribute		
A: I have target for 1 year and 3 year.
within the next 1 year, my target is complete the system development process. Make TS Application team become the best team in the Application group.
I continue open more training course with on job training and study experience from TL/QV members.
within the next 3 years, I completed renew TL/TS Hoan Kiem system, one of the biggest strategic projects to contribute more value for CVN			
		
Q: what is the biggest problems in your job ?	
A: For each improvement system in our dept, we always have plan to expand for TS/QV factory.
But when we expand system to other factory, for each factory has method and process control different.
So I take lot time to modify for suitable.
PDC operation not unify among 3 factories.
So now I'm process to expand PSI system to TL QV but different point still happen.	
To resolve it, I require them to discuss more to unify on the workflow, standardize job, with window contact is TSPDC1.	
It's really effectively. So far, we save time to modify program and in the future save time to maintainance.					
		
Q: what is the biggest challenge in your dept ?		
A: one of the biggest challenges I face is update new technology.		
Because IT technology always changes day by day.	
Some current technology will become old, end of support and maybe have some risks.	
I evaluate new technology, new version which suitable with current project.	
After that, I update step by step to ensure it's not affect to process.							
		
Q: What will you do when have trouble in job ? How to prevent ?		
A: When I encounter trouble, the first priority is not affect to production and quickly action.
Example: if Hoan Kiem system can not access, it could lead to stop line production.		
the first, I immediately inform my managements & person in-charge of department (almost Assy departments).	
the second, I give temporary action to quickly continue and avoid affect production.	
finally, I horenso with related department to find root cause. After that improve, make why why analysis report, and prevent trouble happen again.

Q: How to resolve conflict in team ?	
A: In the previous project, there were 2 members involved. But they have different development approaches.
 the first, I always prioritize listening and understanding to together information from all related members.
the second, I look for encourage everyone to focus on the common target of the team.
the third, I asked them to evaluate to advantages and disadvantages of each method.
Finally, I want to every members to understand and combine the good points each method to become best practice.
After all, the conflict is resolved, not affect the team's performance and we have a case study to improve technical skill.
				
Q: What is your strong point, weak point ?		
A:My strong point: In my dailly job always have monitoring activities (by monitoring system, by logging, by email).
It help me optimize our products and prevent risks/trouble happen.
My weak point: because I cannot understand department job, so I take time to study to develop system.
To overcome weak point, I have 3 action:
the first dept hold meeting to explain their detail requirements. They will show background jobs: which manual job, excel fille and macro.
the second, increase communicate, actively genba workshop to deeply understand job.
Finally, I will provide fix  forms for department to fill out, through  which we will better understand


Q: How to motivation, strengthen teamwork ?
A:During our work, I have been successfull in building an effective team.
To achieved it, by setting clear target for each project, creating an open and creative working environment.
Always recognizing and reward the contributions of each member.
Example: when developing the project, I encourage all members in the team to popose using new technology.
I recognize the contributions and positive results they bring, maybe optimizing, more security, support visualize. And sometimes we also hold picnic party to improve communication.

Q: how to improve communication with department ?
A: In order mutual understand and quickly completed develop system
when department request IT make system.
IT: at first, IT can not understand department job, we take time to study.
Dept: lack of document & requirement to explainfor IT can understand.
Solution:The first, increase communication with department to clear request, actively genba workshop to deeply understand job of department.
We will provide fixed forms for departments to fill out, through which we will better understand the department's requirements.


What were the challenges in developing PSI? 
The logic of PSI is very complex and has many processing streams. 
So, we take a long time to develop it, and testing also. 
To overcome difficult, we have 3 following actions:
Firstly, I requested PDC1 to standardize the process and workflow.
Secondly, I divided it into many small steps and implemented each part.
Finally, I hold regular review meeting everyweek to confirm the results achieved or not achieved. 
After that, we give solutions or continue to explain in more detail.



what are you doing after promotion ?
- the first, as a programming team leader, I will guide team members in perfecting the software development process and improving team effeciency.
- the seconds, I will continue training not only IT members of IT Division but also IT members of other department to enhanced programming skills and help them optimize production system.
- finally, I will proactively explore new technology trends and propose new product ideas.



What is your mission ?
my target is to become a master developing software that optimizes production.
I want to create software tools that act as a virtual assistant for factory,help us work more efficiently,
reduce trouble, and increase productivity.
For example, I could develop software that helps us predict raw material needs, thereby reducing stockouts or overstocking.


why your dept member regisn, overtime ?
I think it's some reason:
- The workload has increased recently due to new projects and urgent demands.
- Sometimes we lack of staff shortages in critical position, remain members need to take care, so it is over workload.
- Some of our workflow are not efficiently, leading to wasted time and effort.
- finally, some employee may not have been suitable at CVN environment or job requirements.
To resolve it, 
- temporary action: I'm implemented measures such as re-arrange/re-assign/share job to other members, supporting each other to overcome challenges and first priority urgent/important job.
- for long-term solutions: we've focus on workflow improvement, encourage creativity and study from other department, outside company.



what is your dept problem ?
the problem is my dept have 1 application group but allocate at 3 factories: TL team, TS team, QV team.
we have many members with different levels of experience and also new comers. beside that each team have different teachnical approaches.
So, the difficult is how to support each other and together working in the same project.
to overcome, 
the first, I continue open training course, on job training to other member. 
the second, I make complete software development process to standardize our workflow.
from that, we have the same approach and the problem is resolve.
